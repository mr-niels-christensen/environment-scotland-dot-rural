Documentation files
===================

The documentation is provided in the subdirectories below the current one.

-  In `pdf` you will find generated PDF versions of the guides and diagrams.
-  In `graphml` you will find the raw versions of the diagrams, in the `.graphml` format. If you wish to edit these, I recommend the free program `yed`, available from [https://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_download.html](https://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_download.html)
-  In `md` you will find the raw versions of the guides, in MarkDown (`.md`) format. These are most easily viewed directly on GitHub, e.g. at [https://github.com/mr-niels-christensen/environment-scotland-dot-rural/blob/master/docs/md/add-feature-ask-the-experts.md](https://github.com/mr-niels-christensen/environment-scotland-dot-rural/blob/master/docs/md/add-feature-ask-the-experts.md)
    +  The raw guide files can be edited in any text editor; MarkDown is more or less plain text. A guide to the format is available here: [ https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet​]( https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet​)
    +  To convert a guide into PDF, I recommend using the service at [http://www.markdowntopdf.com/](http://www.markdowntopdf.com/)
